📘 Project Title: 
Employee Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Description:
The Employee Salary Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately estimates the salary (or monthly income) of employees based on various personal, performance, and organizational attributes. The dataset used, named employee.csv,contains detailed records of employees, including their demographic information, job roles, education, performance metrics, and more.

By leveraging this data, we aim to uncover patterns and key factors influencing employee compensation, which can support HR departments in making data-driven decisions regarding recruitment, promotions, and compensation planning.

📂 Dataset Description:
The dataset includes features such as:

EmployeeID

Gender

EducationLevel

JobRole

YearsAtCompany

MonthlyIncome (Target Variable)

PerformanceRating

Department

JobSatisfaction

OverTime

And many others...

Most features are either categorical or numerical, with MonthlyIncome being the continuous target variable to predict.

🔍 Problem Statement:
Objective: Predict the monthly income (MonthlyIncome) of employees based on their characteristics and job-related attributes.

Challenges:

Handling categorical features like job role, department, gender, etc.

Dealing with multicollinearity and feature scaling.

Evaluating regression performance accurately.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas, numpy for data handling

matplotlib, seaborn for visualization

scikit-learn for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation

Models Used:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

🚀 Workflow
Data Collection
The dataset is uploaded as a ZIP file and extracted using Python.

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Label Encoding for categorical variables

Feature Scaling using Standard Scaler

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution plots

Correlation heatmaps

Outlier analysis

Model Building

Linear Regression as a baseline model

Random Forest Regressor for improved performance

Model Evaluation:

Metrics used: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score

Visualization of actual vs predicted values

Model Export (Optional)

The trained model is saved using joblib for later deployment or use.

📊 Expected Outcomes:
Accurate salary predictions for new or existing employees

Identification of important features affecting salary (e.g., Job Role, Experience, Education)

Insights into employee compensation structure

✅ Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively applied in the HR domain to estimate salaries based on structured data. The predictive model can help organizations in fair compensation planning, reducing biases, and understanding employee value drivers more comprehensively.
